      #### The default datasets in DataBricks did not provide the soource freshness (time data loaded into EDL)
      #### If the source freshness is provided in the column name "_etl_loaded_at", the implementation is as follows.
        # loaded_at_field: _etl_loaded_at
        # freshness:
        #   warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
        #   error_after: {count: 24, perios: hour}
